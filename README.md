# e-commerce app

Live project is available at https://pdelekta-ecommerce.netlify.app/

### Design

Product page and navigation bar is my implementation of the frontendmentor challenge available at https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ecommerce-product-page-UPsZ9MJp6

## Tech stack

- React 18.2.0
- React-Redux 8.0.2
- @reduxjs/toolki 1.8.3
- React-Router v6
- Sass 1.54.0

## What I have learned?

- problem solving with React, Redux, Async Thunk, component lifecycle etc.
- managing state in single store,
- practical use of React-Redux and reduxjs/toolkit libraries especially async thunks and dispatching them in components,
- creating mock API for testing purposes using mockapi.io
- practical use of Sass,
- creating and designing a solution that is scalable and relatively easy to develop and maintain in the future
